# Rampant Tactics
Factorio Mod - Improves the enemies tactics by using potential fields/pheromones allowing probing of defenses, retreats, reinforcements, counterattacking, breaching, raids, rallying death cry, and player hunting. Uses nonhoming blockable biter projectiles. Adds new Enemies (disabled by default). Difficulty setting in mod options menu.

# Notes

0.14.14 factorio version fixed save corruption  
0.14.10 factorio version fixed more pathing issues  
0.14.4 factorio version fixed some issues with unit groups commands  

There will be a pause the first time and on every upgrade that Rampant loads.  
This is due to indexing all the chunks that have been generated.  

MP should be working  
If experiencing desyncs, after an update, please do the following:  
	1) let me know  
	2) Load save with Rampant enabled  
	3) Save the map after Rampant has been updated  
	4) Load save in step 3  

Configure Options not in game menu:  
- Ramp up to max biter wave size  

# Features

- New Enemy Factions - Neutral, Acid, Fast, Physical, Electric, Inferno, Suicide, Fire, Nuclear, Laser, Troll, Wasp, Spawner  
- Swarming - Units will smoothly slide by one another allowing for streamlined attacking  
- Difficulty Scaling - A mod option to control how quickly the ai can perform actions like making attack waves.  
- Nocturnal Mode - A mod option to force biters to only attack at night. Does not yet affect vanilla attacks. Best use with clockwork or daynight extender mod  
- Recycling Biters - When large groups of biters form on the game map and aren't assigned to a unit group or near a base will be periodically removed and refunded to the ai causing attack waves proportional to the number of units removed.  
- Breaching - When biters are destroying structures nearby unit groups will come to join them  
- Frenzy squads - When a unit group gets close to a player or start combat they switch to attacking everything in there path for a set radius or until there is nothing left  
- Rabid squads - Is in a permanent frenzied state as soon as the group is formed  
- Tactical Retreats - These will take place when a unit group is in a chunk that has reached a death threshold  
- Unit Group Forming - Any chunks with spawners in it that is covered by a pollution or player clouds will form groups based on the evolution factor  
- Probing Behavior Against Defenses - unit groups will attempt to avoid chunks that are soaked in death  
- Player Hunting - Unit groups will track the player based on there emitted pheromone cloud  
- Rallying Death Cry - When a unit is killed on a chunk that is past the retreat threshold, the unit will attempt to summon reinforcements to help them  
- Counterattacks - When the player is in combat near nests they will send reinforcements to unit groups  
- Reinforcements - Nests will send assistance to nearby nests under attack by the player  
- No Homing Projectiles - All projectiles are fired at locations and no longer track the player  
- Pathfinding - Unit groups will use potential fields to perform only single step pathfinding allowing for efficient and dynamic pathing  
- Peace mode - If something sets peace mode, Rampant will respect it  
- Ion Cannon Reaction - Firing the Ion Cannon will cause nests around the blast site to form into an attack wave and agitate all biters  
- Rocket Reaction - Firing the rocket from the rocket silo will cause the biters to form extra attack waves  
- Blockable Projectiles - Some of the biters projectiles can now be blocked by walls and trees  
- Raiding AI state - The AI will periodically send attack waves based on building proximity and not just pollution  
- Migration AI State - Where the ai looks for resources patches to setup new bases  
- Sieging AI state - Where the ai does a migration event but also builds towards the player and their base  
- Onslaught AI state - Where the ai gains 2x credits per logic cycle that can be used on units and buildings  
- Vanilla AI Replacement - The default expansion and attack waves can be completely turned off and allow Rampant to work its magic
