[mod-setting-description]
apm_lib_inserter_iterations_01759=Here you can set the maximum of how many inserters per tick should be checked by the script. This is important for the ability of the inserters to check and clear burned-fuel-inventorys on machines, chain fuel through machineries and for burner-inserter to pick up fuel from the pickup and drop targets for them self. (Default is 15 per tick -> 900 inserters/s)
apm_lib_inserter_valid_targets=List of prototypes, separated by commas, that can have a burner energy source with a burnt fuel inventory (car and locomotive doesn't need to be in this list, thy are handelt by the base game)
apm_lib_storage_spit_out=This option controls if the inventory of destroyed storage containers should spit items out on the ground.
apm_lib_storage_spit_out_mark_deconstruct=Ensures that construction bots can collect them immediately.
apm_lib_storage_spit_out_iterations=Minimum: 1, Default: 48 (unmodded steel chest size)
apm_lib_radiation_dmg=If activated, the character will be slightly damaged if it has a radioactive item in inventory or in hand.
apm_lib_radiation_dmg_multiplier=Minimum: 0.1, Default: 1.0
apm_lib_radiation_dmg_based_on_stack=If activated, the radiation damage will be increased with each entity
apm_lib_stack_size=Default item's stack size (Recomended: 200)
apm_lib_stack_size_ash=Stack size of Ash (Recomended: 2000)
