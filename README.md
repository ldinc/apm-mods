# Description

The factorio mod set.

Fork for https://mods.factorio.com/user/AmatorPhasma

# Notes

[goft](https://github.com/ldinc/go-factorio-tools) tool is used to build mods from source.

# Currently updated to version Factorio 2.0:

- apm_lib
- apm_power
- apm_nuclear
- apm_energy_addon
- apm_resource_pack
- rampart_heavy_wall

# Maintenance is currently abandoned:

- apm_recycling (with factorio 2.0 it doesn't make sense). Recomended alt: [scrap-industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/scrap-industry) by SafTheLamb
- apm_starfall (I have no experience playing with it in the original, it looks unfinished along the way, but there were no development plans left by the author.)
- apm_bob_rework (fun project, first try to make complex overhaul mode, with factorio 2.0 it doesn't make sense. Maybe it will be recreated with improvements... and without bob's mods)
- bobmods_gfxtweak (was temp fix for factorio release. Factorio 2.0 + updated graphics for bob's mod and reskin mod are better)
- rso/rampant mods - temporary fix or improvements. Depricated.
