Short list for future development.

# Ideas

- [ ] Move apm_fertiliser_1 in its own technology?
- [ ] After fixing by WUBE crashing with research triggers -> add some reserach triggers to APM's tech.
- [ ] Create own icon for this technology ___apm_wood_liquefaction___ ?
- [ ] [__Space Age__] Add frozen patch to sprites?
- [ ] Add adjustable count of burnt results cell? 
- [ ] Better ReadMe ...
- [ ] Drop unnessacry compabilities...
- [ ] Fill info for factoriopedia ...
- [ ] Adding rotatable entities. The fast way - clone sprites. The hard way - rerender all sprites with animation ...

# Known bugs

# To investigate

- [ ] Logics with burner inserter leeching fuel. It works bad, when your base have a lot of inserters and machines with intensive production. Maybe adding some energy & force leeching fuel on tick to inserter & machine is better way to handle it. Another problem - is ASH. Maybe burner inserter should pass ash from self to target unit (like assembling machine or similar). The simplest solution now is use void energy source for burner inserter (make it be only mechanical inserters).

# Compatabilities

- [ ] Better intergration for space-age
- [ ] AAI Loader
- [ ] AAI?
